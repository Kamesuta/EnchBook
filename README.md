**EnchBook** is a fun new plugin giving server owners/admins the ability to customize Enchanted Books by adding whatever enchantments and levels they would like to add.


### FEATURES:
- Create new enchanted books with a simple intuitive command (yes, you can also get these from creative, I know I know)
- Add any enchantment and level to any enchanted book, also with the intuitive command (Can't do that in creative now can ya? :eek:)
- Intuitive command? What's that you say? Its pretty fancy, when you type /EnchBook <new/add> it autofills in all the options for enchants. Start typing and the list will dwindle down showing available options. Find the one you want, then hit tab. THEN... it will show the MAX level for said enchantment. It couldn't get any easier than that could it?
- SafeEnchants option - This setting is enabled by default, making sure whomever uses this command can only create enchanted books with the max enchant level for that enchantment. You can turn this off and add any level enchantment you want (More of a safety feature if many admins have access to this command) [NOTE: As of currently, if you add a level of enchant that is higher than max, when you put it in an anvil, that amount will not apply to the tool - Hoping to be able to find away around this in the future]
